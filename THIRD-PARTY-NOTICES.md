# Third-party notices

Auto Hunt Train ships spawn points derived in part from the three MIT licensed datasets below. The generator in `tools/MarkSpawns` reads the first two at the pinned commits listed here and writes the hunt mark points to `AutoHuntTrain/Core/Hunts/Data/MarkSpawnTable.g.cs`. The generator in `tools/MobSpawns` reads the second at its pinned commit and writes the monster points for the Hunting Log and custom lists to `AutoHuntTrain/Core/Spawns/Data/MobSpawnTable.g.cs`. The generator in `tools/HuntSpawns` reads the third at its pinned commit and writes the spawn points hunt marks share per zone to `AutoHuntTrain/Core/Marks/Data/HuntSpawnTable.g.cs`. Only the derived coordinates are shipped; the datasets themselves are not redistributed.

- Used: one world position (X, Y, Z) per hunt target, keyed by MobHuntTarget row. A position is kept only when its territory and monster name match the game's own hunt sheets.

## FFXIV Teamcraft

- Source: https://github.com/ffxiv-teamcraft/ffxiv-teamcraft, file `libs/data/src/lib/json/monsters.json` at commit `46dde90c0b070fb13197977fb01fdf288fd56aec`.
- Used: reported monster positions, keyed by BNpcName.
  - Hunt marks: positions limited to each target's own map. The map coordinates are converted to world X and Z and merged into points at least 15 yalms apart. Heights are not taken from this dataset for hunt marks.
  - Hunting Log and custom lists: positions of every monster with a named BNpcName row, limited to open-world zones. The map coordinates are converted to world X and Z, and the reported z times 100 is kept as a height hint that the plugin snaps to the ground. Positions recorded during a FATE are dropped for a monster and zone that has any other position. The rest are merged into points at least 25 yalms apart, and each monster keeps up to 16 points per zone, the most reported first.

## Hunt Helper

- Source: https://github.com/imaginary-png/HuntHelper, file `HuntHelper/Data/SpawnPointData.json` at commit `aadf7cb1945b05544b8d0340042c6a38497860bf`.
- Used: the spawn points of every open-world hunt zone, each flagged with the mark ranks (B, A, S) that can appear at it. The map coordinates are converted to world X and Z; heights are not in the dataset, so the plugin snaps each point to the ground. A run over a hunt mark visits the points of its rank in its zone, after any position the datasets above report for that mark.
